      Hi, I’m Zina. I’m a Software Developer and curious human currently based
      in Newcastle, Australia. In my present role with
      <a href="https://www.orica.com/">Orica</a>, I build user interfaces
      people around the world use daily to make their work seamless and
      productive. Our team and I focus our efforts on creating and maintaining a
      suite of products enabling our customers to perform mining operations in a
      safe and efficient way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time, I spend way too much time browsing other people’s
      Instagram feeds, enrol in Coursera courses to forget about them the next day,
      experiment with web technology when I find the time between browsing the
      aforementioned feeds and doing online courses. I do read too sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I bet I’ve got more Chrome tabs open than you at any given time!
      How many opened tabs do you have? -
